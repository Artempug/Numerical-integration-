Numerical integration is a method of calculating integral values ​​using numerical algorithms and computer programs, which found application in in many fields of science and technology. It allows you to calculate values integrals with high accuracy, which is its main advantage. 

This laboratory involves numerical integration using Simpson's rule and the estimation of integration errors using the Runge's rule.
